To specify an area directly with id, since plain text name can be fuzzy due to different versions. 

area( <id>).a 

Then we can query the elements, for example, ways with some tags WITHIN the area:

way["highway"]["tunnel"="yes"](area.a);

If there are too many hits and we may just want to see the count of hits:

out count;

The area(s) can be given with LIKE operator. the following returns motorway ways:

[out:json][timeout:60];
area["name"~"Graubünden"]->.searchArea;
(
  way["highway"="motorway"](area.searchArea);
);
out body;

Querying for elements using named or id'ed area is a matter of luck. Presumably result can only be found if the name has exact matches and yielding the id's and then there are elements which are linked the id's. 
Using bounding box or a circle ( center plus distance / radiuos) are likely more reliable way to find nodes.

Lets try to determine the data model used by OSM. 

It is a big joke: many ways have the tag highway=pedestrian and tunnel=yes. So using these tags to query car traffic is read bad idea. Better maxspeed=80 or overtaking=no.
